                    In 1974, at the ISKCON center in the countryside near Frankfurt, West Germany, His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada had the following dialogue with Professor Karlfried Graf von Durckheim. Professor Durckheim, a noted religious psychologist and author of Daily Life as Spiritual Exercise, holds a Ph. D. in analytic psychology and is renowned for establishing a therapeutic school in Bavaria that incorporates both Western and Eastern approaches to the psychology of consciousness. In this conversation Srila Prabhupada explains the.first and most basic principle of reincarnation -- that the spiritual living entity is different from the material body. After establishing that the conscious self and the body are separate entities. Sr/la Prabhupada describes how the conscious self, or soul, perpetually transmigrates to another body at the time of death.

                    In my work, I've found that the natural ego doesn't like to die. But if you go through it [a near-death experience], you seem to cross the threshold of death to quite a different reality.

                    Yes, it is different. The experience is like that of a diseased person regaining his health.

                    It's not the person who has died, but the body. According to Vedic knowledge, the body is always dead. For example, a microphone is made of metal. When electric energy passes through the microphone, it responds by converting sound into electrical impulses, which are amplified and broadcast over loudspeakers. But when there is no electricity in the system, nothing happens. Whether the microphone is working or not, it remains nothing more than an assembly of metal, plastic, etc. Similarly, the human body works because of the living force within. When this living force leaves the body, it is said that the body is dead. But actually it is always dead. The living force is the important element; its presence alone makes the body appear to be alive. But "alive" or "dead," the physical body is nothing more than a collection of dead matter.

                  The dead body is not the real subject for philosophical
                  inquiry. Rather, we should concern ourselves with the active
                  principle -- that principle which makes the dead body move --
                  the soul.

                  It's a very simple matter. There is an active principle which
                  makes the body move; when it is absent, the body no longer
                  moves. So the real question is, "What is that active
                  principle?" This inquiry lies at the heart of Vedanta
                  philosophy. In fact, the Vedanta-sutra begins with the
                  aphorism <i>athato brahma-jijnasa</i> -- "What is the nature
                  of the self within the body?" Therefore, the student of Vedic
                  philosophy is first taught to distinguish the difference
                  between a living body and a dead one. If he is unable to grasp
                  this principle, we then ask him to consider the problem from
                  the standpoint of logic. Anyone can see that the body is
                  changing and moving because of the presence of the active
                  principle, the soul. In the absence of the active principle,
                  the body neither changes nor moves. So there must be something
                  within the body that makes it move. It is not a very
                  cliffficult concept.
              </p>

                <p>
                  The body is always dead. It is like a big machine. A tape
                  recorder is made of dead matter, but as soon as you, the
                  living person, push a button, it works. Similarly, the body is
                  also dead matter. But within the body is the life force. As
                  long as this active principle remains within the body, the
                  body responds and appears alive. For instance, we all have the
                  power to speak. If I ask one of my students to come here, he
                  will come. But if the active principle leaves his body, I may
                  call him for thousands of years, but he will not come. This is
                  very simple to understand.

                <p>
                  But what exactly is that active principle? That is a separate
                  subject matter, and the answer to that question is the real
                  beginning of spiritual knowledge.

                  I can understand the point you made about the dead body --
                  that there must be something within to make it alive. The only
                  proper conclusion is that we are talking about two things --
                  the body and the active principle. But my real question is,
                  how do we become aware of the active principle within
                  ourselves as a direct experience and not simply as an
                  intellectual conclusion? On the inner path isn't it important
                  to actually experience this deeper reality?</font

                  You yourself are that active principle. The living body and
                  the dead body are different. The only difference is the
                  presence of the active principle. When it is not there, the
                  body is called dead. So the real self is identical with the
                  active principle. In the Vedas we find the maxim so 'ham -- "I
                  am the active principle." It is also said,
                  <i>aham brahmasmi:</i> "l am not this material body. I am
                  Brahman, spirit." That is self-realization. The self-realized
                  person is described in </font

                  when one is self-realized, he neither hankers nor laments.

                  How can he not experience it? He knows that he is the active
                  principle. Everyone ultimately knows that they are not the
                  body. Even a child knows it. We can observe this by examining
                  the way we speak. We say, "This is my finger." We never say,
                  "I finger." So what is that "I"? This is self-realization --
                  "I am not this body."</font

                <p>
                  And this realization can be extended to other living beings.
                  Why does man kill animals? Why give trouble to others? One who
                  is self-realized can see, "Here is another self. He simply has
                  a different body, but the same active principle that exists
                  within my body is operating within his body." The
                  self-realized person sees all living entities with equal
                  vision, knowing that the active principle, the self, is
                  present not only in human beings, but within the bodies of
                  animals, birds, fish, insects, trees, and plants as well.

                  The active principle is the soul, and the soul transmigrates
                  from one body to another at the time of death. The body may be
                  different, but the self remains the same. We can observe this
                  change of body even within our own lifetime. We have
                  transmigrated from babyhood to childhood, from childhood to
                  youth, and from youth to adulthood. Yet all the while, the
                  conscious self, or soul, has remained the same. The body is
                  material, and the actual self is spiritual. When one comes to
                  this understanding, he is called self-realized.

                  monuments over it. This is body consciousness. But no one

                  During World War I, when I was a young man, I spent four years
                  at the front. I was one of two officers in my regiment who was
                  not wounded. On the battlefield, I saw death again and again.
                  I saw people standing just next to me get hit, and suddenly
                  their life force was gone. All that was left, as you say, was
                  a body without a soul. But when death was near and I accepted
                  that I also might die, I realized that within myself was
                  something that has nothing whatsoever to do with death.</font

                  The process of self-realization is a sequence of inner
                  experiences, isn't it? Here in Europe, the people have gone
                  through such experiences. In fact, I believe this is the real
                  treasure of Europe -- that there are so many people who went
                  through the battlefields, through the concentration camps,
                  through the bombing raids. And within their hearts they retain
                  the memories of those moments when death was near, when they
                  were wounded and nearly torn in pieces, and they experienced a
                  glimpse of their eternal nature. But now it's necessary to
                  show people that they don't need a battlefield, a
                  concentration camp, or a bombing raid in order to take
                  seriously those inner experiences when one is suddenly touched
                  by a sense of divine reality and understands that this bodily
                  existence is not the all and all.</font

                  We can experience that every night. When we dream, our body
                  lies on the bed, but we go somewhere else. In this way we all
                  experience that our real identity is separate from this body.
                  When we dream we forget the body Lying on the bed. We act in
                  different bodies and in different locations. Similarly, during
                  the day we forget our dream bodies in which we traveled to so
                  many places. Perhaps, in our dream bodies, we flew in the sky.
                  At night we forget our waking body, and in the daytime we
                  forget our dream body. But our conscious self, the soul, still
                  exists, and we remain aware of our existence in both bodies.
                  Therefore, we must conclude that we are not any of these
                  bodies. For some time we exist in a certain body, then at
                  death we forget it. So the body is really only a mental
                  structure, somewhat like a dream, but the self is different
                  from all of these mental structures. That is self-realization.

                  Yes, that is the pure ego. For instance, now I have this
                  seventy-eight-year-old Indian body, and I have this false ego
                  that thinks, "I am Indian," "I am this body." This is a
                  misconception. Someday this temporary body will vanish and
                  I'll get another temporary body. It's just a temporary
                  illusion. The reality is that the soul, based on its desires
                  and activities, transmigrates from one body to another.</font

                  Yes. Pure consciousness, the soul, does not need a material
                  body. For instance, when you dream, you forget your present
                  body, but you still remain conscious. The soul, the
                  consciousness, is like water: water is pure, but as soon as it
                  falls from the sky and touches the ground, it becomes
                  muddy.</font

                  Similarly, we are spirit souls, we are pure, but as soon as we
                  leave the spiritual world and come in contact with these
                  material bodies, our consciousness becomes covered. The
                  consciousness remains pure, but now it is covered by mud (this
                  body). And this is why people are fighting. They are wrongly
                  identifying with the body, thinking, "I am German," "I am
                  English," "I am black," "I am white," "I am this," "I am that"
                  -- so many bodily designations. These bodily designations are
                  impurities. This is why artists sculpt or paint nude figures.
                  In France, for example, they regard nakedness as "pure" art.
                  Similarly, when you understand the "nakedness," or true
                  condition, of the spirit soul -- without these bodily
                  designations -- that is purity.</font

                  It is not difficult. You can experience it. It is only because
                  of foolishness that people think differently; but everyone
                  really knows, "I am not this body." This is very easy to
                  experience. I am existing. I understand that I have existed in
                  a baby's body, I have existed in a child's body, and also in a
                  boy's body. I have existed in so many bodies, and now I am in
                  an old man's body. Or, for example, say you have now put on a
                  black coat. The next moment you may put on a white coat. But
                  you are not that black or white coat; you have simply changed
                  coats. If I call you "Mr. Black Coat," that is my foolishness.
                  Similarly, in my lifetime I have changed bodies many times,
                  but I am not any of these bodies. This is real
                  knowledge.</font

                  It seems to me that there is a big difference between the
                  Eastern and Western approaches to this problem of body and
                  soul. In the teachings of the East, you have to become free of

                  realize the spirit within the body.</font

                  This is very easy to understand. We have heard from
                  <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>that we are spirit, that we are within
                  the body. Our sufferings come about because of our
                  identification with the body. Because I have entered into this
                  body, therefore I am suffering. So, either Eastern or Western,
                  my real business should be how to get out of this body. Is
                  that point clear?</font

                  The term reincarnation means that I am a spirit soul who has
                  entered a body. But in my next life I can enter another body.
                  It may be a dog's body, it may be a cat's body, or it may be a
                  king's body. But there will be suffering -- either in the
                  king's body or in the dog's body. These sufferings include
                  birth, death, old age, and disease. So in order to abolish
                  these four kinds of suffering, we have to get out of the body.

                  It doesn't matter whether you are Christian, Muslim, or Hindu.
                  Knowledge is knowledge. Wherever knowledge is available, you
                  must pick it up. And this is knowledge -- every living being
                  is imprisoned within a material body. This knowledge applies
                  equally to Hindus, Muslims, Christians -- everyone. The soul
                  is imprisoned within the body and must therefore undergo
                  birth, death, old age, and disease. But we all want to live

                  Yes, that is the real point. A human being can understand what
                  he is. The birds and beasts cannot understand. So, as humans,
                  we should endeavor for self-realization and not simply act on
                  the level of the birds and beasts. Therefore the Vedanta-sutra
                  begins with the aphorism <i>athato brahma-jijnasa</i> -- human
                  life is meant for inquiring about the Absolute Truth. That is
                  the aim of human life, not eating and sleeping like the
                  animals. We possess extra intelligence with which to
                  understand the Absolute Truth. In </font

                  enables one to inquire about the Absolute Truth. This should
                  be the goal of all works."

                  You cannot do good to others, because you do not know what
                  good is. You are thinking of good in terms of the body -- but
                  the body is false in the sense that you are not the body. For
                  instance, you might occupy an apartment, but you are not that
                  apartment. If you simply decorate the apartment and forget to
                  eat, can that be good?</font

                  What I mean to say is that there must be a very intimate
                  connection between the body and the soul, a kind of oneness --
                  at least, as long as we are alive.</font

                  No; that is not real oneness. There is a difference. For
                  instance, the room we are presently in is important to me only
                  as long as I am alive. Otherwise, it has no importance. When
                  the soul leaves the body, the body is thrown away, even though
                  it was very dear to its owner.</font

                  It is not a question of what you want. You must separate. As
                  soon as your death comes, your relatives will throw out your
                  body.</font

                  Perhaps it makes a difference if a person thinks, "I am the
                  spirit, and I have a body," rather than "I am the body, and I

                  Yes. It is a mistake to think that you are the body and
                  possess a soul. That is not true. You are the soul, and you
                  are covered by a temporary body. The soul is the important
                  thing, not the body. For example, as long as you wear a coat,
                  it is important to you. But if it becomes torn, you throw it
                  away and purchase another coat. The living being constantly
                  experiences the same thing. You separate from this present
                  body and accept another body. That is called death. The body
                  which you previously occupied becomes unimportant, and the
                  body you now occupy becomes important. This is the big problem
                  -- people give so much importance to a body that within a few
                  short years will be exchanged for another one.</font
