                      "Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting," writes British
                      poet William Wordsworth in his famous "Intimations of
                      Immortality." And in another poem, he addressed the following
                      lines to an infant:<br />
                      <br />
                      Oh, sweet new-comer to the changeful earth<br />
                      If, as some darkling seers have boldly guessed,<br />
                      Thou hadst a being and a human birth,<br />
                      And wert erewhile by human parents blessed,<br />
                      Long, long before thy present mother pressed<br />
                      Thee, helpless stranger, to her fostering breast.<br />
                      <br />
                      In the following historical narration from </font
                    ><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Srimad-Bhagavatam</font
                    ><font face="Arial"
                      >, King Citraketu's son reveals his previous births and
                      instructs the King and Queen about the imperishable nature of
                      the soul and the science of reincarnation.<br />
                      <br />
                      King Citraketu had many wives, and although he was capable of
                      producing children, he did not receive a child from any of
                      them, for his beautiful wives were all barren.<br />
                      <br />
                      One day the mystic sage Angira came to Citraketu's palace. The
                      King immediately stood up from his throne and, as was the
                      Vedic custom, paid his respects.<br />
                      <br />
                      "O King Citraketu, I can observe that your mind is disturbed.
                      Your pale face reflects your deep anxiety. Have you not
                      achieved your desired goals?" the sage inquired.<br />
                      <br />
                      Because he was a great mystic, Angira knew the cause of the
                      King's distress, but for his own reasons he questioned
                      Citraketu, as if in need of knowledge.<br />
                      <br />
                      King Citraketu replied, "O Angira, because of your great
                      penances and austerities, you have acquired complete
                      knowledge. You can understand everything, both external and
                      internal, about embodied souls like myself. O great soul, you
                      are aware of everything, yet you ask why I am in such anxiety.
                      Therefore, in response to your order, let me disclose the
                      cause of my suffering. A starving man cannot be satisfied with
                      a garland of flowers. In the same way, my vast empire and
                      immeasurable wealth mean nothing, for I am bereft of a man's
                      true wealth. I do not have a son. Can you not help me to
                      become truly happy and arrange for me to have a son?"<br />
                      <br />
                      Angira, who was very merciful, agreed to help the King. He
                      performed a special sacrifice to the demigods and then offered
                      the remnants of the sacrificial food to the most perfect of
                      Citraketu's queens, Krtadyuti. "O great King, you will now
                      have a son who will be the cause of both jubilation and
                      lamentation," Angira said. The sage then vanished, without
                      waiting for the King's response.<br />
                      <br />
                      Citraketu was overjoyed to learn that he would finally get a
                      son, but he wondered about the sage's last words.<br />
                      <br />
                      "Angira must have meant that I will be greatly happy when my
                      son is born. That is certainly true. But what did he mean by
                      the child being the cause of lamentation? Of course, being my
                      only son, he will automatically become the heir to my throne
                      and kingdom. Therefore, he might become proud and disobedient.
                      That might be a cause for lamentation. But a disobedient son
                      is better than no son at all."<br />
                      <br />
                      In due course of time, Krtadyuti became pregnant, and a son
                      was born. Hearing this news, all the inhabitants of the
                      kingdom rejoiced. King Citraketu could not contain his joy.<br />
                      <br />
                      As the King carefully raised his infant son, his affection for
                      Queen Krtadyuti increased daily, and he gradually lost
                      affection for his barren wives. The other queens continuously
                      lamented their fate, for a wife who has no sons is neglected
                      at home by her husband, and her co-wives treat her exactly
                      like a maidservant. The barren queens burned with anger and
                      envy. As their envy increased, they lost their intelligence,
                      and their hearts became hard like stone. They met secretly and
                      decided that there was only one solution to their dilemma, one
                      way to regain the love of their husband: poison the child.<br />
                      <br />
                      One afternoon, as Queen Krtadyuti walked in the courtyard of
                      the palace, she thought of her son sleeping peacefully in his
                      room. Because she loved the child dearly and could hardly bear
                      to be without him for a moment, she ordered the nurse to
                      awaken him from his nap and bring the boy to the garden.<br />
                      <br />
                      But when the maidservant approached the child, she saw that
                      his eyes were turned upward, and there were no signs of life.
                      Horrified, she held a swab of cotton beneath the boy's
                      nostrils, but the cotton did not move. Seeing this, she cried
                      out, "Now I am doomed!" and fell to the ground. In great
                      agitation, she struck her breast with both hands and wept
                      loudly.<br />
                      <br />
                      Some time passed, and the anxious Queen approached the child's
                      bedroom. Hearing the nurse's wailing, she entered the room and
                      saw that her son had passed from this world. In great
                      lamentation, her hair and dress in disarray, the Queen fell to
                      the ground unconscious.<br />
                      <br />
                      When the King heard of his son's sudden death, he became
                      nearly blind with grief. His lamentation grew like a
                      conflagration, and as he ran to see the dead child, he
                      repeatedly stumbled and fell. Surrounded by his ministers and
                      court officers, the King entered the boy's room and collapsed
                      at the child's feet, his hair and dress scattered in all
                      directions. When he regained consciousness, he was breathing
                      heavily, his eyes were filled with tears, and he was unable to
                      speak.<br />
                      <br />
                      When the Queen saw her husband merged in great lamentation and
                      again viewed the dead child, she began to curse the Supreme
                      Lord. This increased the pain in the hearts of all the
                      residents of the palace. The Queen's flower garlands slipped
                      from her body, and her smooth jet-black hair became tangled.
                      Falling tears smeared the cosmetics beneath her eyes.<br />
                      <br />
                      "O Providence! During the lifetime of the father, you have
                      caused the death of his son. You are certainly the enemy of
                      the living beings and are not at all merciful." Turning to her
                      beloved child, she said, "My dear son, I am helpless and
                      aggrieved. You should not give up my company. How can you
                      leave me? Just look at your lamenting father! You have slept
                      for a long time. Now please get up. Your playmates are calling
                      you to play. You must be very hungry, so please get up
                      immediately and take your lunch. My dear son, I am most
                      unfortunate, for I can no longer see your sweet smiling. You
                      have closed your eyes forever. You have been taken from this
                      planet to another place, from which you will not return. My
                      dear son, unable to hear your pleasing voice, I can no longer
                      maintain my life."<br />
                      <br />
                      The King began crying loudly with an open mouth As the mother
                      and father lamented, all their followers joined them,
                      bemoaning the untimely death of the child. Because of the
                      sudden accident, all the citizens of the kingdom were nearly
                      unconscious with grief.<br />
                      <br />
                      When the great sage Angira understood that the King was almost
                      dead in an ocean of sorrow, he went there with his friend,
                      Saint Narada.<br />
                      <br />
                      The two sages found the King, overwhelmed by lamentation,
                      lying like a dead body beside the corpse. Angira addressed him
                      sharply, "Wake up from the darkness of ignorance! O King, what
                      relationship does this dead body have with you, and what
                      relationship do you have with him? You may say that you are
                      now related as father and son, but do you think that this
                      relationship existed before his birth? Does it truly exist
                      now? Will it continue now that he is dead? O King, as small
                      particles of sand sometimes come together and are sometimes
                      separated due to the force of the ocean's waves, living
                      entities who have accepted material bodies sometimes come
                      together and are sometimes separated by the force of time."
                      Angira wanted the King to understand that all bodily
                      relationships are temporary.<br />
                      <br />
                      "My dear King," the sage continued, "when I first came to your
                      palace, I could have given you the greatest gift --
                      transcendental knowledge -- but when I saw that your mind was
                      absorbed in material things, I gave you only a son, who caused
                      you jubilation and lamentation. Now you are experiencing the
                      misery of a person who has sons and daughters. These visible
                      objects like wife, children, and property are nothing more
                      than dreams. Therefore, O King Citraketu, try to understand
                      who you really are. Consider where you have come from, where
                      you are going after giving up this body, and why you are under
                      the control of material lamentation."<br />
                      <br />
                      Then Narada Muni did something very wonderful. By his mystic
                      power, he brought the soul of the King's dead child into the
                      vision of everyone. Immediately the room became effulgent with
                      a blinding brightness, and the dead child began to move.
                      Narada said, "O living entity, all good fortune unto you. Just
                      see your father and mother. All your friends and relatives are
                      overwhelmed with grief because of your death. Because you died
                      untimely, the balance of your life still remains. Therefore,
                      you may reenter your body and enjoy the remainder of the years
                      allotted to you in this body with your friends and relatives,
                      and later you may accept the royal throne and all the
                      opulences given by your father."<br />
                      <br />
                      By Narada's mystic power, the living entity reentered the dead
                      body. The child who had been dead sat up and began to speak,
                      not with the intelligence of a young boy, but with the full
                      knowledge of a liberated soul. "According to the results of my
                      material activities, I, the living being, transmigrate from
                      one body to another, sometimes going to the species of the
                      demigods, sometimes to the species of lower animals, sometimes
                      incarnating among the vegetables, and appearing sometimes in
                      the human species. In which birth were these two people my
                      father and mother? No one is actually my father and mother. I
                      have had millions of so-called parents. How can I accept these
                      two people as my father and mother?"<br />
                      <br />
                      The Vedas teach that the eternal living being enters a body
                      made of material elements. Here we find that such a living
                      being entered a body produced by King Citraketu and his wife.
                      Actually, however, he was not their son. The living entity is
                      the eternal son of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but
                      because he wants to enjoy this material world, God gives him a
                      chance to enter various bodies. Yet the pure living being has
                      no true relationship with the material body he gets from his
                      father and mother. Therefore, the soul who had taken the body
                      of Citraketu's son flatly denied that the King and Queen were
                      his parents.<br />
                      <br />
                      The soul continued, "In this material world, which is like a
                      swiftly flowing river, all people become friends, relatives,
                      and enemies in due course of time. They also act neutrally and
                      in many other relationships. But despite these various
                      transactions, no one is permanently related."<br />
                      <br />
                      Citraketu was lamenting for his son, who was now dead, but he
                      could have considered the situation otherwise. "This living
                      entity," he could have thought, "was my enemy in my last life,
                      and now, having appeared as my son, he is prematurely leaving
                      just to give me pain and agony." Why should the King not
                      consider his dead son his former enemy and instead of
                      lamenting be jubilant because of an enemy's death?<br />
                      <br />
                      The living being in the body of Citraketu's child said, "Just
                      as gold and other commodities are continually transferred from
                      one place to another through buying and selling, so the living
                      entity, as a result of his karma, wanders throughout the
                      universe, being injected into various bodies in different
                      species of life through the semen of one father after
                      another."<br />
                      <br />
                      As explained in </font
                    ><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bhagavad-gita</font
                    ><font face="Arial"
                      >, it is not by any father or mother that the living entity is
                      given birth. The living entity's true identity is completely
                      separate from the so-called father and mother. By the laws of
                      nature, the soul is forced to enter the semen of a father and
                      be injected into the womb of a mother. He cannot directly
                      control the kind of father he will get; this is automatically
                      determined by his activities in previous lives. The laws of
                      karma force him to go to different fathers and mothers, just
                      like a commodity that is bought and sold.<br />
                      <br />
                      The living entity sometimes takes shelter of an animal father
                      and mother and sometimes a human father and mother. Sometimes
                      he accepts a father and mother among the birds, and sometimes
                      he accepts a demigod father and mother in the heavenly
                      planets.<br />
                      <br />
                      As the soul transmigrates through different bodies, everyone,
                      in every form of life -- be it human, animal, tree, or demigod
                      -- gets a father and mother. This is not very difficult. The
                      real difficulty is to obtain a spiritual father -- a bona fide
                      spiritual master. Therefore, the duty of a human being is to
                      search out such a spiritual master, for under his guidance one
                      can become free from the cycle of reincarnation and return to
                      his original home in the spiritual world.<br />
                      <br />
                      "The living being is eternal," the pure soul continued, "and
                      has no relation with so-called fathers and mothers. He falsely
                      accepts himself as their son and acts affectionately. After he
                      dies, however, the relationship is finished. Under these
                      circumstances, one should not be falsely involved with
                      jubilation and lamentation. The living entity is eternal and
                      imperishable, he has no beginning and no end, nor does he take
                      birth or die. The living being is equal in quality to the
                      Supreme Lord. Both are spiritual personalities. But because
                      the living entity is so small, he is prone to be illusioned by
                      the material energy, and thus he creates bodies for himself
                      according to his different desires and activities."<br />
                      <br />
                      The Vedas tell us that the soul is responsible for his lives
                      in the material world, where he is trapped in the cycle of
                      reincarnation, material body after material body. If he likes,
                      he can remain suffering in the prison house of material
                      existence, or he can return to his original home in the
                      spiritual world. Although God arranges through the material
                      energy to give the living beings the bodies they desire, the
                      Lord's true desire is that the conditioned souls get off the
                      punishing merry-go-round of material life and return home,
                      back to Godhead.<br />
                      <br />
                      Suddenly the boy became silent, as the pure soul left the body
                      of the child, and the body fell lifeless to the floor.
                      Citraketu and the other relatives were astonished. They cut
                      the shackles of their affection and gave up their lamentation.
                      Then they performed the funeral ceremony, cremating the body.
                      Queen Krtadyuti's co-wives, who had poisoned the child, were
                      very much ashamed. While lamenting, they remembered the
                      instructions of Angira and gave up their ambition to bear
                      children. Following the directions of the brahmana priests,
                      they went to the bank of the sacred river Yamuna, where they
                      bathed and prayed daily, atoning for their sinful
                      activities.<br />
                      <br />
                      Because King Citraketu and his queen had become fully
                      cognizant of spiritual knowledge, including the science of
                      reincarnation, they easily gave up the affection that leads to
                      pain, fear, grief, and illusion. Although this attachment for
                      the material body is very difficult to overcome, because they
                      severed it with the sword of transcendental knowledge, they
                      were able to give it up very easily.<br />

                      <br />
                      In the first century B.C., the Roman poet Ovid penned these
                      verses describing the fate of an unfortunate person, who, by
                      his actions and desires slid a few notches down the
                      evolutionary scale.<br />

                      I am ashamed to tell you, but I will tell -- <br />
                      I had bristles sprouting on me.<br />
                      I could not speak, but only grunting sounds<br />
                      Came out instead of words.<br />
                      I felt my mouth grow harder.<br />
                      I had a snout instead of a nose,<br />
                      And my face bent over to see the ground.<br />
                      My neck swelled up with great muscles,<br />
                      And the hand that lifted the cup to my lips<br />
                      Made footprints on the ground.<br />
                      <br />

                      >, composed some three thousand years before Ovid's time,
                      contains the following unique story that dramatically reveals
                      the principles of reincarnation in action. India's great and
                      pious monarch, King Bharata, due to his extreme attachment to
                      a deer, had to spend one life in a deer's body before again
                      attaining a human form.<br />
                      <br />
                      King Bharata was a wise and experienced maharaja who one might
                      have thought would rule for hundreds of years. But while in
                      the prime of life, he renounced everything -- his queen,
                      family, and his vast empire -- and went to the forest. In so
                      doing, he was following the advice of the great sages of
                      ancient India, who recommend that one devote the latter part
                      of one's life to self-realization.<br />
                      <br />
                      King Bharata knew that his position as a great monarch was not
                      permanent; therefore, he did not try to keep the royal throne
                      until death. After all, even a king's body ultimately becomes
                      dust, ashes, or food for worms and other animals. But within
                      the body is the imperishable soul, the real self. Through the
                      process of yoga, the self can be awakened to its true
                      spiritual identity. Once this occurs, the soul need not spend
                      another term of imprisonment within a material body.<br />
                      <br />
                      Understanding that the real purpose of life is to free oneself
                      from the cycle of reincarnation, King Bharata journeyed to a
                      sacred place of pilgrimage called Pulaha-asrama, in the
                      foothills of the Himalayas. There, the former king lived alone
                      in the forest along the bank of the Gandaki River. Instead of
                      his royal dress, he now wore only a deerskin garment. His hair
                      and beard grew long and matted and always appeared wet,
                      because he bathed three times a day in the river.<br />
                      <br />
                      Each morning Bharata worshiped the Supreme Lord by chanting
                      the hymns given in the Rg Veda, and as the sun rose he recited
                      the following mantra: "The Supreme Lord is situated in pure
                      goodness. He illuminates the entire universe; by virtue of His
                      different potencies He maintains all living beings desiring
                      material enjoyment, and He bestows all benediction upon His
                      devotees."<br />
                      <br />
                      Later in the day he collected various fruits and roots, and as
                      recommended in the Vedic scriptures, he offered these simple
                      edibles to Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
                      then took them for his food. Even though he had been a great
                      king, surrounded by worldly opulence, now, by the strength of
                      his austerities, all his desires for material enjoyment
                      vanished. Thus he became free of the root cause of bondage in
                      the cycle of birth and death.<br />
                      <br />
                      By his constant meditation upon the Personality of Godhead,
                      Bharata began to experience symptoms of spiritual ecstasy. His
                      heart was like a lake filled with the water of ecstatic love,
                      and when his mind bathed itself in that lake, tears of joy
                      flowed from his eyes.<br />
                      <br />
                      One day while Bharata was meditating near the bank of the
                      river, a doe came there to drink. While she drank, a lion in
                      the forest nearby roared loudly. The doe was pregnant, and as
                      she jumped in great fear and ran from the river, a baby deer
                      fell from her womb into the swiftly flowing waters. The doe,
                      shivering in fright and weak from the miscarriage, entered a
                      cave, where she soon died.<br />
                      <br />
                      As the sage observed the fawn floating down the river, he felt
                      great compassion. Bharata lifted the animal from the water
                      and, knowing it to be motherless, brought it to his asrama.
                      Bodily differences are meaningless from the viewpoint of a
                      learned transcendentalist: because Bharata was self-realized,
                      he saw all living beings with equal vision, knowing that both
                      the soul and the Supersoul (Supreme Lord) are present within
                      the bodies of all. He daily fed the deer with fresh green
                      grass and tried to make it comfortable. Soon, however, he
                      began to develop great attachment for the deer; he lay down
                      with it, walked with it, bathed with it, and even ate with it.
                      When he wanted to enter the forest to collect fruits, flowers,
                      and roots, he would take the deer with him, fearing that if he
                      left it behind, it would be killed by dogs, jackals, or
                      tigers. Bharata took great pleasure seeing the deer leap and
                      frolic in the forest like a child. Sometimes he would carry
                      the fawn on his shoulders. His heart was so filled with love
                      for the deer that he would keep it on his lap during the day,
                      and when he slept, the deer would rest upon his chest. He was
                      forever petting the deer and would sometimes even kiss it.
                      Thus his heart became bound to the deer in affection.<br />
                      <br />
                      Being attached to raising the deer, Bharata gradually became
                      neglectful of his meditation upon the Supreme Lord. He thus
                      became distracted from the path of self-realization, which is
                      the actual goal of human life. The Vedas remind us that the
                      human form is obtained only after the soul undergoes millions
                      of births in lower species of life. This material world is
                      sometimes compared to an ocean of birth and death, and the
                      human body is compared to a solid boat designed to cross this
                      ocean. The Vedic scriptures and the saintly teachers, or
                      spiritual masters, are compared to expert boatmen, and the
                      facilities of the human body are compared to favorable breezes
                      that help the boat ply smoothly to its desired destination.
                      If, with all these facilities, a person does not fully utilize
                      his life for self-realization, then he commits spiritual
                      suicide and risks taking his next birth in an animal body.<br />
                      <br />
                      However, even though Bharata was aware of these
                      considerations, he thought to himself, "Because this deer has
                      taken shelter of me, how can I neglect it? Even though it is
                      disturbing my spiritual life, I cannot ignore it. To neglect a
                      helpless person who has taken shelter of me would be a great
                      fault."<br />
                      <br />
                      One day, as Bharata was meditating, he began, as usual, to
                      think of the deer instead of the Lord. Breaking his
                      concentration, he glanced around to see where the deer was,
                      and when he could not discover it, his mind became agitated,
                      like that of a miser who has lost his money. He got up and
                      searched the area around his asrama, but the deer was nowhere
                      to be found.<br />
                      <br />
                      Bharata thought, "When will my deer return? Is it safe from
                      tigers and other animals? When shall I again see it wandering
                      in my garden, eating the soft green grasses?"<br />
                      <br />
                      As the day wore on and the deer still did not return, Bharata
                      became overwhelmed with anxiety. "Has my deer been eaten by a
                      wolf or a dog? Has it been attacked by a herd of wild boars,
                      or by a tiger who travels alone? The sun is now setting, and
                      the poor animal who has trusted me since its mother died has
                      not yet returned."<br />
                      <br />
                      He remembered how the deer would play with him, touching him
                      with the points of its soft, fuzzy horns. He remembered how he
                      would sometimes push the deer away from him, pretending to be
                      annoyed with it for disturbing his worship or meditation, and
                      how it would then immediately become fearful and sit down
                      motionless a short distance away.<br />
                      <br />
                      "My deer is exactly like a little prince. Oh, when will he
                      again return? When will he again pacify my wounded heart?"<br />
                      <br />
                      Unable to restrain himself, Bharata set out after the deer,
                      following its tiny hoofprints in the moonlight. In his
                      madness, he began to talk to himself: "This creature was so
                      dear to me that I feel as though I have lost my own son. Due
                      to the burning fever of separation, I feel as if I were in the
                      middle of a blazing forest fire. My heart is now blazing with
                      distress."<br />
                      <br />
                      While frantically searching for the lost deer along the
                      dangerous forest paths, Bharata suddenly fell and was fatally
                      injured. Lying there at the point of death, he saw that his
                      deer had suddenly appeared and was sitting at his side,
                      watching over him just like a loving son. Thus, at the moment
                      of his death, the King's mind was focused completely on the
                      deer. In Bhagavad-gita we learn, "Whatever state of being one
                      remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain
                      without fail."<br />
                      <br />
                      King Bharata Becomes a Deer<br />
                      <br />
                      In his next life, King Bharata entered the body of a deer.
                      Most living entities are not able to remember their past
                      lives, but because of the spiritual progress the King had made
                      in his previous incarnation, he could, even though in the body
                      of a deer, understand the cause of his taking birth in that
                      body. He began to lament. "What a fool I was! I have fallen
                      from the path of self-realization. I gave up my family and
                      kingdom and went to a solitary holy place in the forest to
                      meditate, where I always contemplated the Lord of the
                      universe. But due to my foolishness, I let my mind become
                      attached to -- of all things -- a deer. And now I have justly
                      received such a body. No one is to blame but myself."<br />
                      <br />
                      But even as a deer, Bharata, having learned a valuable lesson,
                      was able to continue his progress in self-realization. He
                      became detached from all material desires. He no longer cared
                      for the succulent green grasses, nor did he give a thought to
                      how long his antlers would grow. Similarly, he gave up the
                      company of all deer, male and female alike, leaving his mother
                      in the Kalanjara Mountains, where he had been born. He
                      returned to Pulaha-asrama, the very place where he had
                      practiced meditation in his previous life. But this time he
                      was careful never to forget the Supreme Personality of
                      Godhead. Staying near the hermitages of the great saints and
                      sages, and avoiding all contact with materialists, he lived
                      very simply, eating only hard, dry leaves. When the time of
                      death came and Bharata was leaving the body of the deer, he
                      loudly uttered the following prayer: "The Supreme Personality
                      of Godhead is the source of all knowledge, the controller of
                      the entire creation, and the Supersoul within the heart of
                      every living being. He is beautiful and attractive. I am
                      quitting this body offering obeisances unto Him and hoping
                      that I may perpetually engage in His transcendental loving
                      service."<br />
                      <br />
                      The Life of Jada Bharata<br />
                      <br />
                      In his next life, King Bharata took birth in the family of a
                      pure, saintly brahmana priest and was known as Jada Bharata.
                      By the Lord's mercy, he could again remember his past lives.
                      In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna says, "From Me come remembrance,
                      knowledge, and forgetfulness." As he grew up, Jada Bharata
                      became very much afraid of his friends and relatives, because
                      they were very materialistic and not at all interested in
                      making spiritual progress. The boy was in constant anxiety,
                      for he feared that by their influence, he would again fall
                      down into animal life. Therefore, although he was very
                      intelligent, he behaved just like a madman. He pretended to be
                      dull, blind, and deaf, so that mundane people would not try to
                      taIk to him. But within himself, he was always thinking of the
                      Lord and chanting His glories, which alone can save one from
                      repeated birth and death.<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata's father was filled with affection for his son,
                      and in his heart he hoped that Jada Bharata would someday
                      become a learned scholar. Therefore he tried to teach him the
                      intricacies of Vedic knowledge. But Jada Bharata purposely
                      behaved like a fool so that his father would abandon his
                      attempts to instruct him. If his father told him to do
                      something, he would do exactly the opposite. Nevertheless,
                      Jada Bharata's father, until the time of his death, always
                      tried to instruct the boy.<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata's nine stepbrothers considered him dull and
                      brainless, and when their father died, they abandoned all
                      attempts to educate him. They could not understand Jada
                      Bharata's inner spiritual advancement. But Jada Bharata never
                      protested their mistreatment, for he was completely liberated
                      from the bodily concept of life. Whatever food came his way,
                      he would accept it and eat, whether it was much or little,
                      palatable or unpalatable. Since he was in full transcendental
                      consciousness, he was not disturbed by material dualities like
                      heat and cold. His body was as strong as a bull's, and his
                      limbs were very muscular. He didn't care for winter's cold,
                      summer's heat, wind, or rain. Because his body was perpetually
                      dirty, his spiritual knowledge and effulgence were covered,
                      just like a valuable gem covered by dirt and grime. Each day
                      he was insulted and neglected by ordinary people, who
                      considered him to be nothing more than a useless fool.<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata's only wages were the small portions of
                      unpalatable foodstuffs provided by his brothers, who made him
                      work like a slave in the fields. But he was unable to perform
                      even simple tasks satisfactorily, because he did not know
                      where to spread dirt or where to make the ground level. For
                      food, his brothers gave him broken rice, rice chaff, oil
                      cakes, worm-eaten grains, and burned grains that had stuck to
                      the bottom of the cooking pots, but Jada Bharata gladly
                      accepted all this as if it were nectar. And he never held any
                      grudges. He thus displayed the symptoms of a perfectly
                      self-realized soul.<br />
                      <br />
                      Once a leader of a band of thieves and murderers went to the
                      temple of the goddess Bhadrakali to offer in sacrifice a dull,
                      unintelligent human being resembling an animal. Such
                      sacrifices are nowhere mentioned in the Vedas and were
                      concocted by the robbers for the purpose of gaining material
                      wealth. Their plan was foiled, however, when the man who was
                      to have been sacrificed escaped, so the chief robber sent his
                      henchmen out to find him. Searching through fields and forests
                      in the darkness of night, the robbers came to a rice field and
                      saw Jada Bharata, who was sitting on high ground guarding the
                      field against the attacks of wild boars. The robbers thought
                      Jada Bharata would be a perfect sacrifice. Their faces shining
                      with happiness, the robbers bound him with strong ropes and
                      brought him to the temple of the goddess Kali. Jada Bharata,
                      because of his complete faith in the protection of the Supreme
                      Lord, did not protest. There is a song by a famous spiritual
                      master that reads, "My Lord, I am now surrendered unto You. I
                      am Your eternal servant, and if You like You can kill me, or
                      if You like You can protect me. In any case, I am fully
                      surrendered unto You."<br />
                      <br />
                      The robbers bathed Jada Bharata, dressed him in new silk
                      garments, and decorated him with ornaments and garlands. They
                      fed him a sumptuous last meal and brought him before the
                      goddess, whom they worshiped with songs and prayers. Jada
                      Bharata was forced to sit before the deity. Then, one of the
                      thieves, acting as the chief priest, raised a razor-sharp
                      sword to slit Jada Bharata's throat so they could offer Kali
                      his warm blood as liquor.<br />
                      <br />
                      But the goddess could not bear this. She understood that the
                      sinful thieves were about to kill a great devotee of the Lord.
                      Suddenly, the form of the deity burst open and the goddess
                      herself appeared, her body burning with an intense,
                      intolerable effulgence. The infuriated goddess flashed her
                      blazing eyes and displayed her fierce, curved teeth. Her eyes,
                      crimson orbs, glowered, and she appeared as if she were
                      prepared to destroy the entire cosmos. Leaping violently from
                      the altar, she quickly decapitated all the rogues and thieves
                      with the very sword with which they had intended to kill the
                      saint Jada Bharata.<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata Instructs King Rahugana<br />
                      <br />
                      After his escape from the Kali temple, Jada Bharata continued
                      his wanderings, remaining aloof from ordinary, materialistic
                      men.<br />
                      <br />
                      One day, as King Rahugana of Sauvira was being carried through
                      the district on a palanquin resting on the shoulders of
                      several servants, the men, who were fatigued, began to falter.
                      Realizing they would need another carrier to help them cross
                      the Iksumati River, the King's servants began searching for
                      someone. Soon they saw Jada Bharata, who appeared to be a good
                      choice because he was very young and strong as an ox. But
                      because he saw all living beings as his brothers, Jada Bharata
                      could not perform this task very well. As he walked, he kept
                      stopping to be sure that he wasn't stepping on any ants.
                      According to the subtle but precise laws of reincarnation, all
                      living entities must remain for a specific length of time in a
                      particular body before being promoted to a higher form. When
                      an animal is killed before its time, the soul must return to
                      that same species to complete its encagement in that type of
                      body. Therefore, the Vedas enjoin that one should always avoid
                      whimsically killing other living beings.<br />
                      <br />
                      Unaware of what was causing the delay, King Rahugana shouted,
                      "What's going on? Can't you carry this thing properly? Why is
                      my palanquin shaking like this?"<br />
                      <br />
                      Hearing the threatening voice of the King, the frightened
                      servants replied that the disturbance was being caused by Jada
                      Bharata. The King angrily chastised him, sarcastically
                      accusing Jada Bharata of carrying the palanquin like a weak,
                      skinny, tired old man. But Jada Bharata, who understood his
                      true spiritual identity, knew that he was not his body. He was
                      neither fat, nor lean, nor thin, nor did he have anything to
                      do with the lump of flesh and bones that comprised his body.
                      He knew that he was an eternal spirit soul situated within the
                      body, like a driver within a machine. Therefore, Jada Bharata
                      remained unaffected by the King's angry criticism. Even if the
                      King were to order him killed, he would not have cared,
                      because he knew that the soul is eternal and can never be
                      killed. As Lord Krsna says in the Gita, "The soul is not slain
                      when the body is slain."<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata remained silent and kept carrying the palanquin
                      as before, but the King, unable to control his temper,
                      shouted, "You rascal, what are you doing? Don't you know that
                      I am your master? For your disobedience I shall now punish
                      you!"<br />
                      <br />
                      "My dear King," said Jada Bharata, "whatever you have said
                      about me is true. You seem to think that I have not labored
                      hard enough to carry your palanquin. That is true, because
                      actually I am not carrying your palanquin at all! My body is
                      carrying it, but I am not my body. You accuse me of not being
                      very stout and strong, but this merely shows your ignorance of
                      the spirit soul. The body may be fat or thin, or weak or
                      strong, but no learned man would say such things about the
                      real selt within. As far as my soul is concerned, it is
                      neither fat nor skinny; therefore you are correct when you say
                      that I am not very strong."<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata then began to instruct the King, saying, "You
                      think you are lord and master, and you are therefore trying to
                      command me, but this is also incorrect, because these
                      positions are ephemeral. Today you are a king and I am your
                      servant, but in our next lives our positions may be reversed;
                      you may be my servant and I your master."<br />
                      <br />
                      Just as the waves of the ocean bring pieces of straw together
                      and then break them apart, the force of eternal time brings
                      living entities together in temporary relationships, such as
                      master and servant, and then breaks them apart and rearranges
                      them.<br />
                      <br />
                      "In any case," Jada Bharata continued, "who is master, and who
                      is servant? Everyone is forced to act by the laws of material
                      nature; therefore no one is master and no one is servant."<br />
                      <br />
                      The Vedas explain that the human beings in this material world
                      are like actors on a stage, performing under the direction of
                      a superior. Onstage, one actor may play the role of a master,
                      and another may play the role of his servant, but they are
                      both actually the servants of the director. In the same way,
                      all living entities are the servants of the Supreme Lord, Sri
                      Krsna. Their roles as masters and servants in the material
                      world are temporary and imaginary.<br />
                      <br />
                      After explaining all this to King Rahugana, Jada Bharata said,
                      "If you still think that you are the master and that I am the
                      servant, I shall accept this. Please order me. What can I do
                      for you?"<br />
                      <br />
                      King Rahugana, who had been trained in spiritual science, was
                      astonished to hear the teachings of Jada Bharata. Recognizing
                      him as a saintly person, the King quickly descended from his
                      palanquin. His material conception of himself as a great
                      monarch had been obliterated, and he fell humbly to the
                      ground, his body outstretched, offering obeisances, his head
                      at the feet of the holy man.<br />
                      <br />
                      "O saintly person, why are you moving through the world
                      unknown to others? Who are you? Where do you live? Why have
                      you come to this place? O spiritual master, I am blind to
                      spiritual knowledge. Please tell me how I may advance in
                      spiritual life."<br />
                      <br />
                      King Rahugana's behavior is exemplary. The Vedas declare that
                      everyone, even kings, must approach a spiritual master in
                      order to gain knowledge of the soul and the process of
                      reincarnation.<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata replied, "Because his mind is full of material
                      desire, the living entity takes on different bodies in this
                      material world, to enjoy and suffer the pleasures and pains
                      brought about by material activity."<br />
                      <br />
                      When one sleeps at night, one's mind creates many dreamlike
                      situations of enjoyment and suffering. A man may dream that he
                      is associating with a beautiful woman, but this enjoyment is
                      illusory. He may also dream that he is being chased by a
                      tiger, but the anxiety he experiences is also unreal. In the
                      same way, material happiness and distress are simply mental
                      creations, based on identification with the material body and
                      material possessions. When one awakens to his original,
                      spiritual consciousness, he sees that he has nothing to do
                      with these things. One accomplishes this by concentrating
                      one's mind in meditation upon the Supreme Lord.<br />
                      <br />
                      If one fails to constantly fix one's mind on the Supreme Lord
                      and render service to Him, he must undergo the cycle of birth
                      and death described by Jada Bharata.<br />
                      <br />
                      "The condition of the mind causes births in different types of
                      bodies," Jada Bharata said. "These bodies may be those of many
                      different species, for when one uses the mind to understand
                      spiritual knowledge, he gets a higher body, and when one uses
                      it only for obtaining material pleasure, he receives a lower
                      body."<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata compared the mind to a flame in a lamp. "When the
                      flame burns the wick improperly, the lamp is blackened with
                      soot. But when the lamp is filled with clarified butter and
                      the flame burns properly, the lamp produces brilliant
                      illumination. The mind absorbed in material life brings
                      endless suffering in the cycle of reincarnation, but when the
                      mind is used to cultivate spiritual knowledge, it brings about
                      the original brightness of spiritual life."<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata then warned the King, "As long as one identifies
                      with the material body, one must wander throughout the
                      unlimited universes in different species of life. Therefore,
                      the uncontrolled mind is the greatest enemy of the living
                      being.<br />
                      <br />
                      "My dear King Rahugana, as long as the conditioned soul
                      accepts the material body and is not freed from the
                      contamination of material enjoyment, and as long as he does
                      not conquer his senses and his mind and come to the platform
                      of self-realization by awakening his spiritual knowledge, he
                      is forced to wander in different places and in different forms
                      in this material world."<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata then revealed his own past lives. "In a previous
                      birth, I was known as King Bharata. I attained perfection by
                      becoming completely detached from material activities. I was
                      fully engaged in the service of the Lord, but I relaxed my
                      control over my mind and became so affectionate to a small
                      deer that I neglected my spiritual duties. At the time of
                      death I could think of nothing but this deer, so in my next
                      life I had to accept the body of a deer."<br />
                      <br />
                      Jada Bharata concluded his teachings by informing the King
                      that those who desire freedom from the cycle of reincarnation
                      must always associate with self-realized devotees of the Lord.
                      Only by associating with exalted devotees can one attain the
                      perfection of knowledge and cut to pieces the illusory
                      associations of this material world.<br />
                      <br />
                      Unless one has the opportunity to get the association of the
                      devotees of the Lord, he can never understand the first thing
                      about spiritual life. The Absolute Truth is revealed only to
                      one who has attained the mercy of a great devotee, because in
                      the assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of
                      discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In
                      an assembly of pure devotees, there is discussion only of the
                      qualities, forms, and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of
                      Godhead, who is praised and worshiped with full attention.
                      This is the simple secret by which one can revive his dormant
                      spiritual consciousness, end forever the vicious cycle of
                      reincarnation, and return to a life of eternal pleasure in the
                      spiritual world.<br />
                      <br />
                      After receiving lessons from the great devotee Jada Bharata,
                      King Rahugana became fully aware of the constitutional
                      position of the soul and gave up completely the bodily
                      conception of life, which chains the pure souls to the endless
                      cycle of birth and death in the material world.<br />

                      As the soul sets out on its mysterious journey after death, it
                      may, according to the traditions of the world's great
                      religions, meet with beings from other levels of reality --
                      angels who help it, or judges who weigh its good and evil
                      deeds on the scales of cosmic justice. A variety of religious
                      art objects, spanning the entire range of man's cultural
                      history, depict such scenes. A painting on a fragment of
                      Etruscan pottery shows an angelic figure attending a fallen
                      warrior. A Christian mosaic from the Middle Ages shows a grim
                      St. Michael, the scales of justice in his hands. Many people
                      who have had near-death experiences often report encountering
                      such beings.<br />
                      In the Vedic scriptures of India we learn of the servants of
                      Lord Visnu, who appear at the time of death to accompany the
                      pious soul on its way to the spiritual world. The Vedas also
                      tell of the fearsome agents of Yamaraja, the lord of death,
                      who forcefully arrest the soul of a sinful man and prepare it
                      for its next incarnation in the prison of a material body. In
                      this historical account, the servants of Visnu and the
                      servants of Yamaraja dispute the fate of the soul of Ajamila,
                      deciding whether he should be liberated or reincarnated.<br />
                      <br />
                      In the city of Kanyakubja, there once lived a young saintly
                      brahmana priest named Ajamila, who fell from the path of
                      spiritual life and lost all of his good qualities when he fell
                      in love with a prostitute. Giving up his priestly duties,
                      Ajamila now made his living through robbery and gambling and
                      passed his life in debauchery.<br />
                      <br />
                      By the time he was eighty-eight years old, Ajamila had
                      fathered ten sons by the prostitute. The youngest, a baby, was
                      named Narayana -- one of the names of the Supreme Lord, Visnu.
                      Ajamila was very attached to his young son and derived great
                      pleasure watching the child's early attempts to walk and
                      talk.<br />
                      <br />
                      One day, without warning, the time of death arrived for the
                      foolish Ajamila. Terrified, the old man saw before him
                      gruesome figures with fierce, twisted faces These subtle
                      beings with ropes in their hands had come to forcibly escort
                      him to the court of Yamaraja, the lord of death. Seeing these
                      ghoulish creatures, Ajamila became bewildered, and out of
                      affection for his beloved child, who was playing a short
                      distance away, he began to cry loudly, "Narayana! Narayana!',
                      With tears in his eyes, weeping for his young son, the great
                      sinner Ajamila unconsciously chanted the holy name of the
                      Lord.<br />
                      <br />
                      Hearing their master's name chanted with great feeling by the
                      dying Ajamila, the order carriers of Visnu, the Visnudutas,
                      arrived within a second. They appeared just like Lord Visnu
                      Himself. Their eyes were exactly like the petals of a lotus
                      flower; they wore helmets of burnished gold, glimmering silk
                      garments the color of topaz; and their perfectly formed bodies
                      were decorated with garlands of sapphire and milk-white
                      lotuses. They appeared fresh and youthful, and their dazzling
                      effulgence illuminated the darkness of the death chamber. In
                      their hands they held bows, arrows, swords, conchshells,
                      clubs, discs, and lotus flowers.<br />
                      <br />
                      The Visnudutas saw the servants of Yamaraja, the Yamadutas,
                      snatching Ajamila's soul from the core of his heart, and with
                      resounding voices they cried, "Stop!"<br />
                      <br />
                      The Yamadutas, who had never before encountered any
                      opposition, trembled upon hearing the Visnudutas' harsh
                      command. "Who are you? Why are you trying to stop us?" they
                      asked. "We are the servants of Yamaraja, the lord of
                      death."<br />
                      <br />
                      The agents of Visnu smiled and spoke in voices as deep as the
                      rumbling of rain clouds: "If you are truly the servants of
                      Yamaraja, you must explain to us the meaning of the cycle of
                      birth and death. Tell us: Who must enter this cycle, and who
                      must not?"<br />
                      <br />
                      The Yamadutas replied, "The sun, fire, sky, air, demigods,
                      moon, evening, day, night, the directions, water, land, and
                      the Supersoul, or the Lord within the heart, all witness the
                      activities of everyone. The candidates for punishment in the
                      cycle of birth and death are those who are confirmed by these
                      witnesses to have deviated from their religious duties. In
                      proportion to the extent of one's religious or irreligious
                      actions in this life, one must enjoy or suffer the
                      corresponding reactions of karma in the next."<br />
                      <br />
                      Originally the living beings exist in the spiritual world as
                      eternal servants of God. But when they give up the service of
                      the Lord, they must enter the material universe, comprised of
                      the three modes of nature -- goodness, passion, and ignorance.
                      The Yamadutas explained that the living beings who desire to
                      enjoy this material world come under the control of the modes
                      and, according to their specific relationship with these
                      modes, acquire suitable material bodies. A being in the mode
                      of goodness obtains the body of a demigod, one in the mode of
                      passion takes birth as a human, and one in the mode of
                      ignorance enters the lower species.<br />
                      <br />
                      All of these bodies are like the bodies we experience in
                      dreams. When a man goes to sleep, he forgets his real identity
                      and may dream that he has become a king. He cannot remember
                      what he was doing before he went to sleep, nor can he imagine
                      what he will do upon waking. In the same way, when a soul
                      identifies with a temporary, material body, he forgets his
                      real, spiritual identity, as well as any previous lives in the
                      material world, although most souls in a human body have
                      already transmigrated through all 8,400,000 species of
                      life.<br />
                      <br />
                      "The living entity thus transmigrates from one material body
                      to another in human life, animal life, and life as a demigod,"
                      the Yamadutas said. "When the living entity gets the body of a
                      demigod, he is very happy. When he gets a human body, he is
                      sometimes happy and sometimes sad. And when he gets the body
                      of an animal, he is always fearful. In all conditions,
                      however, he suffers terribly, experiencing birth, death,
                      disease, and old age. His miserable condition is called
                      samsara, or transmigration of the soul through different
                      species of material life.<br />
                      <br />
                      "The foolish embodied living entity," the Yamadutas continued,
                      "unable to control his senses or his mind, is forced to act
                      according to the influence of the modes of material nature,
                      even against his own desires. He is like a silkworm that uses
                      its own saliva to create a cocoon and then becomes trapped in
                      it. The living entity traps himself in a network of his own
                      fruitive activities and then can find no way to free himself.
                      Thus he is always bewildered and repeatedly dies and is
                      reborn.<br />
                      <br />
                      "Because of his intense material desires," said the Yamadutas,
                      "a living entity takes birth in a particular family and
                      receives a body like that of either the mother or the father.
                      That body is an indication of his past and future bodies, just
                      as one springtime is an indication of past and future
                      springtimes."<br />
                      <br />
                      The human form of life is especially valuable, because only a
                      human can understand the transcendental knowledge that can
                      free him from the cycle of birth and death. But Ajamila had
                      wasted his human life.<br />
                      <br />
                      "In the beginning," the Yamadutas said, "Ajamila studied all
                      the Vedic literatures. He was a reservoir of good character
                      and conduct. He was very mild and gentle, and he kept his mind
                      and senses under control. He was always truthful, knew how to
                      chant the Vedic mantras, and was very pure. Ajamila always
                      showed proper respect to his spiritual master, guests, and the
                      elderly members of his household -- indeed, he was free from
                      false prestige. He was benevolent to all living beings and
                      never envied anyone.<br />
                      <br />
                      "But once, Ajamila, following the order of his father, went to
                      the forest to collect fruits and flowers. On the way home, he
                      came upon a very lusty, low-class man shamelessly embracing
                      and kissing a prostitute. The man was smiling, singing, and
                      enjoying himself as if this were proper behavior. Both the man
                      and the prostitute were drunk. The prostitute's eyes were
                      rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose,
                      partially exposing her body. When Ajamila saw this prostitute,
                      the dormant lusty desires in his heart awakened, and in
                      illusion, he fell under their control. He tried to remember
                      the instructions of the scriptures, and with the help of his
                      knowledge and intellect he tried to control his lust. But
                      because of the force of Cupid within his heart, he was unable
                      to control his mind. After that, he always thought of the
                      prostitute, and within a short time he took her in as a
                      servant in his house.<br />
                      <br />
                      "Ajamila then gave up all of his spiritual practices. He spent
                      the money he had inherited from his father for presents for
                      the prostitute and even rejected his beautiful young wife, who
                      came from a respectable brahmana family.<br />
                      <br />
                      "This rascal Ajamila got money any way he could, legally or
                      illegally, and used it to maintain the prostitute's sons and
                      daughters. Before death, he did not undergo atonement.
                      Therefore, because of his sinful life, we must take him to the
                      court of Yamaraja. There, according to the extent of his
                      sinful acts, he will be punished and then returned to the
                      material world in a suitable body."<br />
                      <br />
                      After hearing the statements of the Yamadutas, the servants of
                      Lord Visnu, who are always expert in logic and argument,
                      replied, "How painful it is to see that those in charge of
                      upholding religious principles are needlessly punishing an
                      innocent person. Ajamila has already atoned for all of his
                      sins. Indeed, he has atoned not only for sins performed in
                      this life, but for those performed in millions of previous
                      lives as well, because he chanted the holy name of Narayana in
                      a helpless state of mind at the time of death. Therefore, he
                      is now pure and eligible for liberation from the cycle of
                      reincarnation.<br />
                      <br />
                      "The chanting of the holy name of Lord Visnu," the Visnudutas
                      said, "is the best process of atonement for a thief or a
                      drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one
                      who kills a priest, or for one who indulges in sex with the
                      wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best
                      method of atonement for one who murders women, the king, or
                      his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other
                      sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Visnu,
                      such sinful persons may attract the attention of the Supreme
                      Lord, who therefore considers, 'Because this man has chanted
                      My holy name, it is My duty to give him protection.' "<br />
                      <br />
                      In this present age of quarrel and hypocrisy, one who wants
                      liberation from reincarnation should chant the Hare Krsna
                      maha-mantra, the great mantra of deliverance, because it
                      completely cleanses the heart of all material desires that
                      keep one trapped in the cycle of birth and death.<br />
                      <br />
                      The Visnudutas said, "One who chants the holy name of the Lord
                      is immediately freed from the reactions of unlimited sins,
                      even if he chants jokingly or for musical entertainment. This
                      is accepted in the scriptures and by all learned scholars.<br />
                      <br />
                      "If one chants the holy name of Lord Krsna and then dies in an
                      accident or is killed by a deadly animal, from disease, or by
                      a weapon, one is immediately freed from having to take birth
                      again. As a fire burns dry grass to ashes, the holy name of
                      Krsna burns to ashes all of one's karmic reactions."<br />
                      <br />
                      The Visnudutas then said, "If a person unaware of the potency
                      of a medicine takes that medicine or is forced to take it, it
                      will act even without his knowledge. Even if one does not know
                      the value of chanting the holy name of the Lord, the chanting
                      will still be effective in liberating one from
                      reincarnation.<br />
                      <br />
                      "At the time of death," said the Visnudutas, "Ajamila
                      helplessly and very loudly chanted the holy name of the Lord,
                      Narayana. That chanting alone has already freed him from
                      having to take birth again for his sinful life. Therefore, do
                      not try to take him to your master for punishment by another
                      term of imprisonment in a material body."<br />
                      <br />
                      The Visnudutas then released Ajamila from the ropes of the
                      servants of the lord of death. Ajamila came to his senses and,
                      free from fear, paid his heartfelt respects to the Visnudutas
                      by bowing his head at their feet. But when the Visnudutas saw
                      that Ajamila was trying to say something to them, they
                      disappeared.<br />
                      <br />
                      "Was this a dream I saw?" Ajamila wondered. "Or was it
                      reality? I saw fearsome men with ropes in their hands coming
                      to drag me away. Where have they gone? And where are those
                      four radiant persons who saved me?"<br />
                      <br />
                      Ajamila then began to reflect on his life. "Being a servant of
                      my senses, how degraded I became! I fell down from my position
                      as a saintly brahmana and begot children in the womb of a
                      prostitute. Indeed, I gave up my chaste and beautiful young
                      wife. What's more, my father and mother were old and had no
                      other friend or son to look after them. Because I did not take
                      care of them, they lived with great pain and difficulty. It is
                      now clear that a sinful person like myself should have been
                      forced in his next life to suffer hellishly.<br />
                      <br />
                      "I am such an unfortunate person," said Ajamila, "but now that
                      I have another chance, I must try to become free from the
                      vicious cycle of birth and death."<br />
                      <br />
                      Ajamila immediately renounced his prostitute wife and
                      journeyed to Hardwar, a place of pilgrimage in the Himalaya
                      Mountains. There he took shelter at a Visnu temple, where he
                      practiced bhakti-yoga, the yoga of devotional service to the
                      Supreme Lord. When his mind and intelligence were fixed in
                      perfect meditation on the form of the Lord, Ajamila again saw
                      before him four celestial beings. Recognizing them as the same
                      Visnudutas who had saved him from the agents of death, he
                      bowed down before them.<br />
                      <br />
                      There at Hardwar, on the banks of the Ganges, Ajamila gave up
                      his temporary, material body and regained his eternal,
                      spiritual form. Accompanied by the Visnudutas, he boarded a
                      golden aircraft and, passing through the airways, went
