            with death? Have we lived before? Such questions are normally
            identified with religions of the East, where the life of man is
            known to endure not only from the cradle to the grave, but through
            millions of ages, and acceptance of the idea of rebirth is nearly
            universal. As Arthur Schopenhauer, the great nineteenth-century
            German philosopher, once observed, "Were an Asiatic to ask me for
            a definition of Europe, I should be forced to answer him: It is
            that part of the world which is haunted by the incredible delusion
            that man was created out of nothing, and that his present birth is
            his first entrance into life." <font size="-1" face="Arial" color="#0000CC"><i>(Parerga

            material science, has for several centuries stifled any serious or
            widespread interest in the preexistence and survival of
            consciousness beyond the present body. But throughout Western
            history, there have always been thinkers who have understood and
            affirmed the immortality of consciousness and transmigration of
            the soul. And a multitude of philosophers, authors, artists,
            scientists, and politicians have given the idea thoughtful
            consideration.</font></p>

            Pythagoras, and Plato may be numbered among those who made
            reincarnation an integral part of their teachings. At the end of
            his life, Socrates said, "I am confident that there truly is such
            a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the
            dead." </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC"><I>(Phaedo,</I>

            Pythagoras claimed he could remember his past lives, and Plato
            presented detailed accounts of reincarnation in his major works.
            Briefly, he held that the pure soul falls from the plane of
            absolute reality because of sensual desire and then takes on a
            physical body. First, the fallen souls take birth in human forms,
            the highest of which is that of the philosopher, who strives for
            higher knowledge. If his knowledge becomes perfect, the
            philosopher can return to an eternal existence. But if he becomes
            hopelessly entangled in material desires, he descends into the
            animal species of lite. Plato believed that gluttons and drunkards
            may become asses in future lives, violent and unjust people may
            take birth as wolves and hawks, and blind followers of social
            convention may become bees or ants. After some time, the soul
            again attains the human form and another chance to achieve
            liberation. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC">(Phaedrus)<SUP>3</SUP></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
            Some scholars believe that Plato and other early Greek

            religions like Orphism, or from India.</FONT></P>

            indicating that Christ and his followers were aware of the
            principle of reincarnation. Once, the disciples of Jesus asked him
            about the Old Testament prophecy that Elias would reappear on
            earth. In the Gospel of St. Matthew we read, "And Jesus answered
            them, Elias shall truly first come, and restore all things. But I
            say unto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not...

            instance, Jesus and his disciples came across a man blind from
            birth. The disciples asked Jesus, "Who did sin, this man, or his

            his own, it must have been a sin done before his birth -- that is,
            in a previous life. And this was a suggestion that Jesus did not

            remain shrouded in mystery, the Byzantine emperor Justinian in 553
            A.D. banned the teachings of preexistence of the soul from the
            Roman Catholic Church. During that era, numerous Church writings
            were destroyed, and many scholars now believe that references to
            reincarnation were purged from the scriptures. The Gnostic sects,
            although severely persecuted by the church, did, however, manage
            to keep alive the doctrine of reincarnation in the West. (The word

            Giordano Bruno, who was ultimately sentenced to be burned at the
            stake by the Inquisition because of his teachings about
            reincarnation. In his final answers to the charges brought against
            him, Bruno defiantly proclaimed that the soul "is not the body"
            and that "it may be in one body or in another, and pass from body

            understanding about reincarnation, are turning to the original
            sources of knowledge about past and future lives. Among all
            available literatures, the Sanskrit <I>Vedas</I> of India are the
            oldest on earth and present the most comprehensive and logical
            explanations of the science of reincarnation, teachings that have
            maintained their viability and universal appeal for more than five
            thousand years.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The most fundamental information about
            reincarnation appears in <I>Bhagavad-gita,</I> the essence of the
            <I>Upanisads</I> and of all Vedic knowledge. The <I>Gita</I> was
            spoken fifty centuries ago by Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality
            of Godhead, to His friend and disciple Arjuna on a battlefield in
            northern India. A battlefield is the perfect place for a
            discussion about reincarnation, for in combat, men directly
            confront the fateful questions of life. death, and the
            afterlife.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As Krsna begins to speak on the immortality
            of the soul, He tells Arjuna, "Never was there a time when I did
            not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall
            any of us cease to be." The <I>Gita </I>further instructs, "That
            which pervades the entire body you should know to be
            indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul."
            The soul -- here we speak of something so subtle that it is not
            immediately verifiable by the limited human mind and senses.
            Therefore, not everyone will be able to accept the existence of
            the soul. Krsna informs Arjuna, "Some look on the soul as amazing,
            some describe him as amazing, and some hear of him as amazing,
            while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him
            at all."</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Accepting the existence of the soul is,
            however, not merely a matter of faith. <I>Bhagavad-gita</I>
            appeals to the evidence of our senses and logic, so we may accept
            its teachings with some degree of rational conviction and not
            blindly, as dogma.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is impossible to understand reincarnation
            unless one knows the difference between the actual self (the soul)
            and the body. The <I>Gita</I> helps us see the nature of the soul
            by the following example. "As the sun alone illuminates all this
            universe, so does the living entity, one within the body,
            illuminate the entire body by consciousness."</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Consciousness is concrete evidence of the
            presence of the soul within the body. On a cloudy day, the sun may
            not be visible, but we know it is there in the sky by the presence
            of sunlight. Similarly, we may not be able to directly perceive
            the soul, but we may conclude it is there by the presence of
            consciousness. In the absence of consciousness, the body is simply
            a lump of dead matter. Only the presence of consciousness makes
            this lump of dead matter breathe, speak, love, and fear. In
            essence, the body is a vehicle for the soul, through which it may
            fulfill its myriad material desires. The <I>Gita </I>explains that
            the living entity within the body is "seated as on a machine made
            of the material energy." The soul falsely identifies with the
            body, carrying its different conceptions of life from one body to
            another as the air carries aromas. Just as an automobile cannot
            function without the presence of a driver, similarly, the material
            body cannot function without the presence of the soul.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As one grows older, this distinction between
            the conscious self and the physical body becomes more obvious.
            Within his lifetime a person can observe that his body is
            constantly changing. It does not endure, and time proves the child
            ephemeral. The body comes into existence at a certain time, grows,
            matures, produces by-products (children), and gradually dwindles
            and dies. The physical body is thus unreal, for it will, in due
            time, disappear. As the <I>Gita</I> explains, "Of the nonexistent
            there is no endurance." But despite all the changes of the
            material body, consciousness, a symptom of the soul within,
            remains unchanged. ("Of the eternal there is no change.")
            Therefore, we may logically conclude that consciousness possesses
            an innate quality of permanence that enables it to survive the
            dissolution of the body. Krsna tells Arjuna, "For the soul there
            is neither birth nor death at any time... He is not slain when the
            body is slain."</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">But if the soul is "not slain when the body
            is slain," then what becomes of it? The answer given in the
            <I>Bhagavad-gita</I> is that the soul enters another body. This is
            reincarnation. This concept may be diffcult for some people to
            accept, but it is a natural phenomenon, and the <I>Gita</I> gives
            logical examples to aid our understanding: "As the embodied soul
            continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old
            age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober
            person is not bewildered by such a change."</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In other words, man reincarnates even in the
            course of one lifetime. Any biologist will tell you that the
            body's cells are constantly dying and being replaced by new ones.
            In other words, each of us has a number of "different" bodies in
            this very life. The body of an adult is completely different from
            the body the same person had as an infant. Yet despite bodily
            changes, the person within remains the same. Something similar
            happens at the time of death. The self undergoes a final change of
            body. The <I>Gita</I> says, "As a person puts on new garments,
            giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material
            bodies, giving up the old and useless ones." Thus the soul remains
            entrapped in an endless cycle of births and deaths. "One who has
            taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one is sure to
            take birth again," the Lord tells Arjuna.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to the Vedas, there are 8,400,000
            species of life, beginning with the microbes, rising through the
            fish, plants, insects, reptiles, birds, and animals to the humans
            and demigods. According to their desires, the living entities
            perpetually take birth in these species.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The mind is the mechanism that directs these
            transmigrations, propelling the soul to newer and newer bodies.
            The <I>Gita</I> explains, "Whatever state of being one remembers
            when he quits his body, .. that state he will attain without fail
            &#91;in his next life&#93;." Everything we have thought and done
            during our life makes an impression on the mind, and the sum total
            of all these impressions influences our final thoughts at death.
            According to the quality of these thoughts, material nature awards
            us a suitable body. Therefore, the type of body that we have now
            is the expression of our consciousness at the time of our last
            death.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">"The living entity, thus taking another
            gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, eye, tongue, nose, and
            sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a
            particular set of sense objects." the Gita explains. Further, the
            path of reincarnation does not always lead uphill; the human being
            is not guaranteed a human birth in his next life. For example, if
            one dies with the mentality of a dog, then he will in his next
            life receive the eyes, ears, nose, etc., of a dog, thus allowing
            him to enjoy canine pleasures. Lord Krsna confirms the fate of
            such an unfortunate soul, saying, "When one dies in the mode of
            ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom."</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to Bhagavad-gita, humans who do
            not inquire about their nonphysical, higher nature are compelled
            by the laws of karma to continue in the cycle of birth, death, and
            rebirth, sometimes appearing as humans, sometimes as animals, and
            sometimes as plants or insects.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Our existence in the material world is due
            to the multiple karmic reactions of this and previous lives, and
            the human body provides the only loophole through which the
            materially conditioned soul can escape. By properly utilizing the
            human form, one can solve all the problems of life (birth, death,
            disease, and old age) and break the endless cycle of
            reincarnation. If, however, a soul, having evolved to the human
            platform, wastes his life by engaging only in activities for sense
            pleasure, he can easily create sufficient karma in this present
            life to keep him entangled in the cycle of birth and death for
            thousands upon thousands of lives. And they may not all be
            human.</FONT></P>
            
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Lord Krsna says, "The foolish cannot
            understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they
            understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the
            modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can
            see all this. The endeavoring transcendentalists, who are situated
            in self-realization, can see all this clearly. But those whose
            minds are not developed and who are not situated in
            self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may
            try to."</FONT></P>
            
            
           <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A soul fortunate enough to obtain a human body should 
             seriously endeavor for self-realization, to understand the principles of reincarnation 
             and become free from repeated birth and death. We can't afford not to.</FONT></P>
