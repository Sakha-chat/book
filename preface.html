        <p>
          If you want to gain real control over your destiny, you must
          understand reincarnation and how it works. It's that simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one wants to die. Most of us would like to live forever in full
          vigor, without wrinkles, gray hair, or arthritis. This is natural,
          because the first and most basic principle of life is to enjoy. If we
          could only enjoy life forever!
        </p>
        <p>
          Man's eternal quest for immortality is so fundamental that we find it
          nearly impossible to conceive of dying. Pulitzer Prize winner William
          Saroyan
          <font size="2" color="#0000ff">(author of The Human Comedy)</font>
          echoed the views of most people when, in the days just prior to his
          death, he announced to the media, "Everybody has got to die, but I
          have always believed an exception would be made in my case. Now what?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of us seldom, if ever, think about death or what happens
          afterward. Some say that death is the end of everything. Some believe
          in heaven and hell. Still others hold that this life is only one of
          many we have lived and will live in the future. And more than one
          third of the world's population-over 1.5 billion people-accept
          reincarnation as an irrevocable fact of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reincarnation is not a "belief system," or a psychological device for
          escaping the "grim finality" of death, but a precise science that
          explains our past and future lives. Many books have been written on
          the subject, usually based on hypnotic regression, near-death
          experiences, accounts of out-of-body experiences, or deja-vu.
        </p>
        <p>
          But most reincarnation literature is poorly informed, highly
          speculative, superficial, and inconclusive. Some books purport to
          document cases of people who, under hypnosis, have been regressed to previous lifetimes. They describe in detail houses they lived
          in, streets they walked on, parks they frequented as children, and the
          names of their former parents, friends, and relatives. All this makes
          for interesting reading, and while such books have certainly
          stimulated the everwidening public interest and belief in
          reincarnation, careful investigations have revealed that many of these
          so-called past-life regression cases are rife with guesswork,
          inaccuracies, and even fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          But most importantly, none of these popular works explain the
          fundamental facts about reincarnation, like the simple process by
          which the soul eternally transmigrates from one material body to
          another. In rare instances when basic principles are discussed,
          authors generally present their own theories about how and in which
          particular cases reincarnation occurs, as if some special or gifted
          living beings reincarnate and others do not. This type of presentation
          does not deal with the science of reincarnation but introduces,
          instead, a confusing array of fabrications and contradictions, leaving
          the reader with scores of unanswered questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: Does one reincarnate instantaneously or slowly, over a
          long period of time? Can other living beings, like animals,
          reincarnate in human bodies? Can man appear as an animal? If so, how
          and why? Do we reincarnate forever, or does it end somewhere? Can the
          soul suffer perpetually in hell or enjoy forever in heaven? Can we
          control our future incarnations? How? Can we be reborn on other
          planets or in other universes? Do good and evil actions play a role in
          determining our next body? What is the relationship between karma and
          reincarnation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming Back fully answers these questions, because it scientifically
          explains the true nature of reincarnation. Finally, this book provides
          the reader with practical instructions on how to come to grips with
          and rise above the mysterious and generally misunderstood phenomenon
          of reincarnation-a reality that plays a vital role in shaping man's
          destiny.
