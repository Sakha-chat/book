                  <br />
                  The sages of ancient India tell us that the goal of human life
                  is to escape from the endless cycle of reincarnation. Don't
                  come back, they warn.<br />
                  <br />
                  All in all, the situation of the living entity caught in the
                  cycle of birth and death is somewhat like that of the Greek
                  hero Sisyphus, the king of Corinth, who once tried to outwit
                  the gods but was sentenced to a no-win fate. He was given the
                  punishment of rolling a massive stone up a hill, but each time
                  the stone reached the summit, it rolled down again, and
                  Sisyphus was forced to endlessly repeat his arduous task.
                  Similarly, when a living entity in the material world ends one
                  life, he must, by the law of reincarnation, begin another one.
                  In each life, he works hard to achieve his material goals, but
                  his endeavors always end in failure, and he must begin
                  anew.<br />
                  <br />
                  Fortunately, we're not Sisyphus, and there is a way out of the
                  cycle of birth and death. The first step is the knowledge that
                  " I am not this body." The Vedas declare, aham brahmasmi: "I
                  am pure spirit soul." And as spirit souls we all have a
                  relationship with the supreme spirit soul, Krsna, or God. The
                  individual soul may be compared to a spark emanating from the
                  fire of the Supreme Soul. Just as the spark and the fire are
                  of the same quality, the individual soul is of the same
                  spiritual quality as the Supreme Lord. Both share a spiritual
                  nature comprised of eternity, knowledge, and bliss. All living
                  beings originally exist in the spiritual world as
                  transcendental loving servants of God, but when the living
                  entity gives up that relationship, he comes under the control
                  of the material energy. The eternal soul then becomes
                  implicated in the cycle of repeated birth and death, taking
                  different bodies according to his karma.<br />
                  <br />
                  In order to become free from reincarnation, one must
                  thoroughly understand the law of karma. Karma is a Sanskrit
                  term that defines a law of nature analogous to the modern
                  scientific principle of action and reaction. Sometimes we say,
                  "I had that coming to me." We often instinctively realize that
                  we are somehow responsible for the good and bad things that
                  happen to us, although the exact mechanism escapes us.
                  Students of literature use the term "poetic justice" to
                  describe the unhappy fates of ill-motivated characters. And in
                  the realm of religion, theologians debate the meaning of such
                  aphorisms as "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" and "As
                  ye sow, so shall ye reap."<br />
                  <br />
                  But the law of karma goes beyond these vague formulations and
                  aphorisms and encompasses a complete science of action and
                  reaction, especially as it applies to reincarnation. In this
                  life, by our thoughts and actions, we prepare our next body,
                  which may be higher or lower.<br />
                  <br />
                  The human form of life is very rare; the soul gets a human
                  body only after evolving through millions of lower species.
                  And it is only in the human form that the living entity has
                  the intelligence to understand karmic laws and thus become
                  free from reincarnation. The human body is the only loophole
                  by which one can escape the sufferings of material existence.
                  One who misuses the human form and does not become
                  self-realized is no better than a dog or an ass.<br />
                  <br />
                  The reactions of karma are like dust covering the mirror of
                  our pure, original spiritual consciousness. This contamination
                  can only be removed by the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra,
                  which is comprised of the Sanskrit names of God [pronounced
                  Huh-ray; Krish-na; Rahm-uh]:<br />

                  ><br />
                  <br />
                  The power of this mantra (often called the great chant for
                  deliverance) to free one from karma is described throughout
                  the Vedic literature. Srimad-Bhagavatam, the cream of the
                  Puranas, advises, "Living beings who are entangled in the
                  complicated meshes of birth and death can be freed immediately
                  by even unconsciously chanting the holy name of Krsna."<br />
                  <br />
                  In the Visnu-dharma it is said, "This word Krsna is so
                  auspicious that anyone who chants this holy name immediately
                  gets rid of the resultant actions of sinful activities from
                  many, many births." And the Brhan-Naradiya Purana extols the
                  chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra as the simplest means of
                  achieving liberation in the present degraded age.<br />
                  <br />
                  In order to be effective, however, the Hare Krsna mantra must
                  be received from a bona fide spiritual master in the disciplic
                  succession descending from Lord Krsna Himself. It is only by
                  the mercy of such a qualified guru that one can become free
                  from the cycle of birth and death. In Caitanya-caritamrta,
                  Lord Caitanya, who is God Himself, declares, "According to
                  their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the
                  entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper
                  planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower
                  planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living
                  entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to
                  associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of
                  Krsna."<br />
                  <br />
                  How can one recognize such a bona fide spiritual master? First
                  of all, he must be situated in the authorized line of
                  succession descending from Lord Krsna. Such a genuine
                  spiritual master receives the teachings of Lord Krsna through
                  the disciplic chain and simply repeats these teachings,
                  without alteration, just as he has heard them from his own
                  spiritual master. He is not an impersonalist or a voidist but,
                  rather, a representative of the Supreme Personality of
                  Godhead. Moreover, the bona fide spiritual master is
                  completely free from sinful activity (especially meat-eating,
                  illicit sex, gambling, and intoxication) and is always
                  absorbed in God consciousness, twenty-four hours a day.<br />
                  <br />
                  Only such a spiritual master can free one from reincarnation.
                  Material existence may be compared to a vast ocean of birth
                  and death. The human form of life is like a boat capable of
                  crossing this ocean, and the spiritual master is the captain
                  of this boat. He gives the disciple directions by which he can
                  regain his original spiritual nature.<br />
                  <br />
                  At the time of initiation, the spiritual master agrees to
                  accept the remaining karma of the disciple. If the disciple
                  perfectly follows the instructions of the genuine guru, or
                  spiritual master, he becomes free from the cycle of
                  reincarnation.<br />
                  <br />
                  Srila Prabhupada, the founder-acarya of the International
                  Society for Krishna Consciousness, once wrote, "The guru takes
                  on a very great responsibility. He must guide his disciple and
                  enable him to become an eligible candidate for the perfect
                  position -- immortality. The guru must be competent to lead
                  his disciple back home, back to Godhead." He often guaranteed
                  that if one did nothing more than sravana, hear about Krsna,
                  the supreme controller and cause of all causes, he would be
                  liberated.<br />
                  <br />
                  Practical Techniques for Becoming Free from Karma and
                  Reincarnation<br />
                  <br />
                  Activities of sense gratification, meant only to please one's
                  mind and senses, are the cause of material bondage, and as
                  long as one engages in such fruitive activities, the soul is
                  sure to continually transmigrate from species to species.<br />
                  <br />
                  Lord Rsabhadeva, an incarnation of Krsna, warned, "People are
                  mad after sense gratification. When a person considers sense
                  gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after
                  materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful
                  activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he
                  has already received a body, which, although temporary, is the
                  cause of his misery. Actually, the living entity should not
                  have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the
                  material body for sense gratification. Therefore, I think it
                  not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in
                  the activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually
                  gets material bodies one after another. As long as one does
                  not inquire about the spiritual values of life, one is
                  defeated and subjected to miseries arising from ignorance. Be
                  it sinful or pious, karma has its resultant actions. If a
                  person is engaged in any kind of karma, his mind is called
                  karmatmaka, or colored with fruitive activity. As long as the
                  mind is impure, consciousness is unclear, and as long as one
                  is absorbed in fruitive activity, he has to accept a material
                  body. When the living entity is covered by the mode of
                  ignorance, he does not understand the individual living being
                  and the supreme living being, and his mind is subjugated to
                  fruitive activity. Therefore, until one has love for God, he
                  is certainly not delivered from having to accept a material
                  body again and again." </font

                ><font face="Arial"
                  ><br />
                  But becoming free from the cycle of birth and death requires
                  more than just theoretical understanding. Jnana, or knowledge
                  that one is not the material body but a spirit soul, is not
                  sufficient for liberation. One must act on the platform of
                  spirit soul. This is called devotional service, which includes
                  many practical techniques for becoming free from karma and
                  reincarnation.<br />
                  <br />
                  1. The first principle of devotional service is that one
                  should always chant the Hare Krsna mantra, Hare Krsna, Hare
                  Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
                  Rama, Hare Hare.<br />
                  <br />
                  2. One should also regularly study the Vedic literatures,
                  especially </font
                ><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bhagavad-gita</font
                ><font face="Arial"> and </font
                ><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Srimad-Bhagavatam</font
                ><font face="Arial"
                  >, in order to develop a thorough understanding of the nature
                  of the self, the laws of karma, the process of reincarnation,
                  and the means for becoming self-realized.<br />
                  <br />
                  3. One should eat only spiritualized vegetarian foods. In </font
                ><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bhagavad-gita</font
                ><font face="Arial"
                  >, Lord Krsna says that one should eat only food that is
                  offered to Him in sacrifice; otherwise, one will become
                  implicated in the reactions of karma.<br />
                  <br />
                  <p align="center">
                  <i style="color: #e58538;"

                  ></p><br />
                  "If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower,
                  fruit or water, I will accept it." </font
                ><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">(Bg. 9.26)</font
                ><font face="Arial">
                  It is clear from this verse that Lord is not interested in
                  offerings of liquor, meat, fish, or eggs, but simple
                  vegetarian foods prepared with love and devotion.<br />
                  <br />
                  We should reflect on the fact that food cannot be produced by
                  men working in factories. Men cannot eat gasoline, plastic
                  microchips, or steel. Food is produced by the Lord's own
                  natural arrangements, and offering food to Krsna is a form of
                  recognizing our debt to God. How does one offer food to Krsna?
                  The technique is very simple and easy to perform. Anyone may
                  keep a small altar in one's home or apartment, with a picture
                  of Lord Krsna and the spiritual master on it. The simplest
                  form of offering is to place the food before the pictures and
                  say, "My dear Lord Krsna, please accept this humble offering,"
                  and chant Hare Krsna. The key to this simple process is
                  devotion. God is not hungry for food, but for our love, and
                  eating this purified food that has been accepted by Krsna
                  frees one from karma and inoculates him against material
                  contamination.<br />
                  <br />
                  4. The positive principle of offering vegetarian food to Krsna
                  automatically includes the negative principle of avoiding
                  meat, fish, and eggs. Eating meat means participating in the
                  business of unnecessarily killing other living beings. This
                  leads to bad karmic reactions in this life or the next. The
                  laws of karma state that if one kills an animal to eat it,
                  then in his next life the killer will also be killed and
                  eaten. There is also karma involved in taking the lives of
                  plants, but this is negated by the process of offering the
                  food to Krsna, because He says He will accept such vegetarian
                  offerings. One should also give up intoxicants, including
                  coffee, tea, alcohol, and tobacco. Indulging in intoxication
                  means associating with the mode of ignorance and may result in
                  one's taking a lower birth in the next life.<br />

                  5. Other techniques for becoming free from the cycle of
                  reincarnation include offering the fruit of one's work to God.
                  Everyone must work for simple bodily sustenance, but if work
                  is performed only for one's own satisfaction, one must accept
                  the karmic results and receive good and bad reactions in
                  future lives. The </font

                ><font face="Arial">
                  warns that work must be performed for the satisfaction of the
                  Lord. This work, known as devotional service, is karma-free.
                  Working in Krsna consciousness means sacrifice. The human
                  being must sacrifice his time or money for the satisfaction of
                  the Supreme. "Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be
                  performed, otherwise work causes bondage in this material
                  world." </font
                ><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">(Bg. 3.9)</font

                ><font face="Arial"
                  >Work performed as devotional service not only saves one from
                  karmic reaction, but gradually elevates one to transcendental
                  loving service of the Lord -- the key to entering the kingdom
                  of God.<br />
                  <br />
                  It is not necessary to change one's occupation. One may be a
                  writer and write for Krsna, an artist and paint for Krsna, a
                  cook and cook for Krsna. Or, if one is not able to directly
                  engage one's talents and abilities in serving Krsna, one may
                  sacrifice the fruits of one's work by contributing a portion
                  of one's earnings to help propagate Krsna consciousness
                  throughout the world. One should, however, always earn one's
                  living by honest means. For example, one should not work as a
                  butcher or gambler.<br />
                  <br />
                  6. Parents must raise their children in God consciousness. The
                  Vedas state that parents are responsible for the karmic
                  reactions of their children. In other words, if your child
                  incurs bad karma, you must suffer some of that karma yourself.
                  Children should be instructed about the importance of obeying
                  God's laws and avoiding sinful behavior and should be taught
                  how to develop love for the Supreme Lord. And parents should
                  make them thoroughly familiar with the subtle laws of karma
                  and reincarnation.<br />
                  <br />
                  7. Krsna conscious persons should not engage in illicit sex,
                  i.e. sex outside of marriage or sex not for the purpose of
                  conceiving a child. It should also be noted that abortion
                  carries a special karmic reaction -- those who participate in
                  killing unborn children may be placed in the womb of a mother
                  who chooses abortion and themselves be slaughtered in the same
                  horrible way. But if one agrees to no longer commit such
                  sinful acts, one can become freed from karmic reaction by
                  inoffensive devotional chanting of the holy names of God.<br />
                  <br />
                  8. One should regularly associate with people who are trying
                  to become free from the influence of karma and who are
                  attempting to break out of the cycle of birth and death.
                  Because they are living in harmony with the spiritual
                  principles governing the universe, devotees of Lord Krsna
                  become transcendental to the influence of material nature and
                  begin to display genuine spiritual characteristics. So just as
                  one can contact a disease by associating with a sick person,
                  one can gradually reawaken one's own transcendental qualities
                  by associating with Krsna's devotees.<br />
                  <br />
                  By following these simple techniques, anyone can become free
                  from the effects of karma. Conversely, if one does not follow
                  them, one is sure to become entangled in the actions and
                  reactions of material life. The laws of nature are very
                  strict, and unfortunately, most people are unaware of them.
                  But ignorance of the law is no excuse. One who is arrested for
                  speeding will not be excused if he tells the judge that he was
                  not aware of the speed limit. If a person is ignorant of the
                  principles of hygiene, nature will not excuse him from
                  incurring disease. And a child ignorant of the nature of fire,
                  if he sticks his hand into it, must be burned. Therefore, in
                  order to free ourselves from the endless repetition of birth
                  and death, we must understand the laws of karma and
                  reincarnation. Otherwise, we will have to come back to this
                  material world again and again; and we must remember that we
                  may not always return as human beings.<br />
                  <br />
                  The soul in its conditioned state perpetually travels through
                  time and space. By the cosmic law of karma, it takes up
                  residence in different bodies on different planets within the
                  material universes. But wherever the soul journeys, it
                  encounters the same conditions. As Lord Krsna says in </font
                ><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bhagavad-gita</font
                ><font face="Arial"> </font
                ><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">(8.16)</font
                ><font face="Arial"
                  >: "From the highest planet in the material world down to the
                  lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and
                  death take place. But one who attains to My abode .. never
                  takes birth again." The Gita and other Vedic literatures are
                  instruction manuals that teach us the real goal of life's
                  journey. By understanding the science of reincarnation, we
                  free ourselves from the forces of karma and return to the
                  antimaterial regions of knowledge, bliss, and eternity.</font
